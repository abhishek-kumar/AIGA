             * contending for time on the threadpool.  Due to the nature of the design of Archiver, it's
             * important that the frames are processed with higher priority than saving them to disk
             * (this minimizes the overhead of exceptions (cpu utilization) during high-stress periods,
             * causing the frames to be lost with the least amount of hiccups on the server.
             * 
             * So here we choose to process the frame on this thread only if we know that it won't get
             * immediate attention on the threadpool.
