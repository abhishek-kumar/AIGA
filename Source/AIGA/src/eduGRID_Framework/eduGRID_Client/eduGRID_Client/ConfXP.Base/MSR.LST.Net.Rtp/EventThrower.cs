    /// This class is used to fire events on a separate thread using a queue of events to fire with a First In, First Out algorithm.
    /// Rather than use the ThreadPool which would not guarantee FIFO since there are 25+ threads to service the events in the queue,
    /// we have a custom object that uses a single thread to service the queue and guarantees FIFO ordering.
    /// 
    /// The reason this class exists is that two initial approaches failed.
    /// 
    /// Approach 1:  Fire events on the thread that discovered them.  For instance, the RtcpListener thread would detect a new
    /// Rtp Participant and would fire RtpParticipantAdded.  The client, upon catching the event, would draw a new Participant in the UI,
    /// but to do so it would have to make a web service call to the Venue Service to get the Participant's icon.  This would take
    /// up to a second and the RtcpListener thread would block while this synchronous call was occuring.  This caused a number of
    /// incoming Rtcp packets to be dropped while the thread was blocked and in high stress conditions would even cause Rtp Participant
    /// timeouts to occur due to a lack of received Rtcp packets for the participant.
    /// 
    /// Approach 2:  Have the main thread forward off events to the ThreadPool for firing.  The problem here was that events would
    /// get queued and then serviced by the 25 threads sitting in the thread pool.  Due to the intricacies of when threads get serviced
    /// by the CPU, we couldn't guarantee the order in which the events would get serviced.  This caused freaky and very rare race
    /// conditions where the client might receive an RtpStreamAdded event before the RtpParticipantAdded event for the RtpParticipant that the
    /// RtpStream belonged to was received, especially prevalent under stress conditions of large numbers of streams/participants or high CPU
    /// utilization.
