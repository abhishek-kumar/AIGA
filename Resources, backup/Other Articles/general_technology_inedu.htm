			<h1>Technology in Education</h1>
                        <!-- there should be no contrib for these --> 
			
			<p>Twenty-five
years ago, having a computer in your classroom—or for that matter, your
school—was a mark of distinction. The idea of bringing the high-tech
into schools was still somewhat cutting edge. But today, things are
different. In fact, no school seems complete without a full complement
of desktop computers, as well as other relatively new forms of
technology. The question is not whether computers belong in classrooms,
but how they can be put to most effective use and how schools can
ensure that all of their students are getting the same online
opportunities.</p>

		<h2>Access</h2>

			<p>In 1996, about
two-thirds of public schools had Internet access, according to data
from the National Center for Education Statistics. By 2003, virtually
every public school could go online. Perhaps even more striking,
high-poverty schools, as well as their low-poverty counterparts, could
boast near-universal access to the Internet by that point.</p>

			<p>From
1999 to 2002, student access to instructional computers improved
dramatically in all types of schools. The ratio of students to
computers dropped from about 5.7-to-1 to 3.8-to-1 during that period.
The pace of improvement was somewhat faster in high-minority and
high-poverty schools, a development that helped narrow the
technology-access gap between such schools and those with lower
concentrations of nonwhite and economically disadvantaged students.</p>

			<p>After
these rapid improvements, the trend toward increasing access to
computers has slowed in the past few years, according to MDR data.
Since 2002, the average level of access has barely budged, remaining
close to four students per instructional computer nationally.</p>

			<p>Yet
even though the overall level of access to instructional computers
appears to have reached a plateau, striking differences exist from
state to state.</p>

			<p>In the average public school in the
nation, 3.8 students share every computer used for instructional
purposes, MDR data for the 2004-05 school year show. However, in
high-access states, such as Maine and South Dakota, schools have an
average of only two students for each computer. At the other extreme,
the student-to-computer ratio exceeds the 5-to-1 mark in California,
New Hampshire, and Utah, a level of computer access less than half of
that found in the leading states.</p>

			<p>Some districts and
states are working to provide students and teachers with greater access
to technology off-campus by purchasing wireless laptops, personal
digital assistants, and hand-held computers that students may take off
school grounds. Maine and New Hampshire, for example, provide middle
school students with laptop computers.</p>

			<p>Despite progress in
the classroom, some indicators suggest a lingering "digital divide" at
home. For example, 28 percent of 4th graders and 24 percent of 8th
grade students who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches
report not having a computer at home. In stark contrast, only seven
percent and five percent of wealthier 4th and 8th graders respectively,
do not have home computers (NAEP, 2003).</p>

		<h2>Capacity</h2>

			<p>Internet-connected
computers have become a fixture in the majority of the nation’s public
schools. Yet, states still have a spotty record in adopting policies to
make sure that educators and students can take advantage of that access.</p>

			<p>While
access to technology within schools has expanded at a rapid rate,
less-dramatic change has been apparent in policies designed to improve
the ability of teachers and administrators to use technology
effectively. In a survey of state education technology officials
conducted for <em>Technology Counts 2006</em>, the Editorial Projects
in Education Research Center found that 40 states had technology
standards for teachers in place for the 2005-06 school year. That
number held steady from the previous year.</p>

			<p>But many states
have not adopted licensure policies to ensure that teachers meet those
standards. Only 21 states require that teachers take one or more
technology courses or pass a technology test before they can receive an
initial teaching license. Teachers are required to demonstrate
competence in technology or complete professional development related
to technology before being recertified in just nine states, most of
which do not include technology requirements as part of initial
licensure. In all, 26 states have policies in place to help ensure that
teachers are competent in technology.</p>

			<p>The EPE Research
Center found that it is less common for states to have standards for
administrators that include technology. Thirty-three states have
technology standards for administrators. Only nine states require
administrators to complete technology coursework or pass a technology
test before they can receive an initial license. An additional six
states require administrators to demonstrate competence in technology
or complete professional development related to technology before being
recertified.</p>

			<p>No state has adopted technology requirements
at both the initial and continuing stages of certification for
administrators. In total, 15 states have policies designed to ensure
that administrators are competent in the use of technology.</p>

			<p>Although
many states have not yet created policies to ensure that educators
become savvy users of technology, MDR data show improvements in the
percentage of schools where most teachers are considered “beginner”
users of technology. That figure has substantially declined in recent
years, from 35 percent in 1999 to 15 percent in 2005.</p>

		<h2>Use</h2>

			<p>Despite
schools' evident commitment to technology, some research indicates that
teachers continue to use computers to maintain their current teaching
methods rather than to promote innovative practices (Cuban, 2001).
Survey data from a 2001 <em>Education Week</em>/Market Data
Retrieval/Harris Interactive poll of students, for example, found that
only 29 percent of students said teachers use a computer to help them
understand a problem in a different way.</p>

			<p>Data from the
2003 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) found that 28
percent of 4th grade teachers reported not using computers at all in
class. Among those who did use computers, the most common uses were
playing math games and engaging in drill-and-practice activities. Tasks
that promote higher-order-thinking skills were used much less
frequently.</p>

			<p>Discrepancies also exist in students' use of
the Internet based on family income. Research by the U.S. Department of
Commerce (2002) found that 35 percent of students aged 10-17 whose
household incomes were less than $15,000 used the Internet at school
compared with 63 percent of students with family incomes of $75,000 or
more. Further, in the lowest income bracket ($15,000 or less), 54
percent of students reported that they didn't use the Internet at all.
By comparison, only 12 percent of students in the highest income
bracket ($75,000 or more), indicated that they didn't use the Internet.</p>

		<h2>Other Uses of Technology</h2>

			<p>The
technology in schools today includes more than the boxy desktop
equipment found in classrooms and computer labs. For instance, teachers
and students alike are learning the benefits of digital whiteboards,
which offer users many of the features of a computer, as well as a
4-by-5 foot screen. Computers are also used to help children with
disabilities in the classroom. For example, e-books may run assistive
software such as Braille printers and audible text-readers.</p>

			<p>In
addition to these classroom-based uses, states are taking steps to help
expand the use of educational technology both through standards for
students and via efforts to push the boundaries of conventional
schooling. The rise of technology in education has also led to the
development of e-learning initiatives, which include online courses,
virtual schools, Internet-based professional development, and online
testing programs.</p>

			<p>E-learning opportunities, in which
instruction takes place over the Internet instead of in a traditional
classroom, are available to a sizable number of students. Twenty-two
states have established a state virtual school, and 16 states have at
least one cyber charter school (<em>Technology Counts 2006</em>).</p>

			<p>In
the 2004-05 school year, according to MDR data, about 19 percent of
public schools offered their own distance-learning programs for
students. But those programs have taken root more strongly in some
states than others. Likely in a reflection of the state’s vast size and
many isolated communities, close to half of all public schools in
Alaska offer distance learning, a rate nearly 2½ times the national
average.</p>

			<p>Some forms of e-learning are expanding more
slowly. For the 2005-06 school year, 22 states offered some form of
computer-based assessment for students. But of the 48 states with
technology standards for students, only four states—Arizona, New York,
North Carolina, and Utah—actually test students on their knowledge of
or ability to use technology (<em>Technology Counts 2006</em>).</p>

		<h2>Impact</h2>

			<p>As
the amount and variety of technology available to schools continues to
grow, the potential for new and innovative ways to enhance students'
educational experiences increases as well. To date, there has been
little research on the impact of technology on student achievement.
However, a recent study found that, despite significant Internet
subsidies in California from 1996 to 2000, there was very little
evidence to show that the expansion of Internet availability had a
significant impact on student achievement in the Golden State (Goolsbee
&amp; Guryan, 2002).</p>

			<p>There also have been a few studies
focusing on teaching and learning with technology and its impact on
student achievement. For example, a meta-analysis focused specifically
on reading and math educational software, revealed a somewhat strong
association between the use of the software and student achievement in
these subjects (Murphy et al., 2002). Another meta-analysis found that
teaching and learning with technology had a small, but positive effect
on student outcomes (Waxman, Connell, &amp; Gray, 2002).</p>

			<p>Ultimately,
technology's impact on student achievement is difficult to measure
because the areas it can affect—such as higher-order thinking,
creativity, and research skills—are themselves difficult to quantify.
Still, some studies have demonstrated that some uses of technology can
boost student achievement under certain conditions, but there is no
"magic formula that educators and policymakers can use to determine if
this 'return' is actually worth the 'investment'" (Ringstaff &amp;
Kelley, 2002).</p>
